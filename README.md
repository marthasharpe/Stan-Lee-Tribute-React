# Stan Lee React App

### A re-make of my Stan Lee Tribute Page using React.  

In this React App, users interact with the page to get Stan Lee quotes one at a time in a single word-bubble.  
The original page used plain HTML and CSS and showed the whole array of quotes in several word-bubbles.  

Visit the React App [here](https://stan-lee-tribute.netlify.com/ "Stan Lee Tribute React").  
Or see the original page [here](http://marthadawn.com/Stan%20Lee%20Tribute/index.html "Stan Lee Tribute Page").
